# I thought I recorded Audio, but it didn't sadly.
# Here is What is said in Video.
 - I decided to use bank churn dataset for this demo
 - I took two datasets from different sources that you provided in drive.
 - First I analysed the datasets and found that second dataset has many columns and I removed columns that doesn't contribute to trainining ML model.
 - Then I matched the colum's names refering first dataset for seemless access.  And I mapped few data like 'Male' to 'M' to make the available datas for a cloumn look similar.
 - Then I preprocessed the datasets, performed PDA to detect patterns (you can see analysed datas in screenshots) and extracted features.
 - Used Logistic Regression to train the model.
 - Got around 80% accuracy.
 - Then I used Gradio (Similar to Streamlit) for creating user interface for this demo.
 - We can use gradio API any where and integrate with any interface.
 - We can use ngrok and custom domain to permanently host as a website.


I created a little documentation in Readme file in GITHUB, to see how it works and how to execute, to mimic the result. Kindly Please look into that.
